#DICE PERCENTAGE
# Create an array with 6 elements named dice. Fill this array with the value zero.
# Generate a random number with a value between 1 and 6 (just like a dice) in a repetition 5000 times.

# If the value is 1, increase the element 0 in the array by 1, the same applies to 
# the values 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The dice[0] element indicates the number of times value 1 has occurred.
# Or in general: dice[x-1] indicates the number of times that x has been thrown.

# At the end of the repetition, print the contents of the array as percentages with 2 decimal places.
# For example; "Percentage of throws of value 3 = 16.28%"
