#BASIC IMPORT 
# Create a Python module called my_dice.py and export the code you wrote in question 2 into a function 
# called rollDice(number).
#      Changes:
# Instead of repetition of 5000 times, makes a repetition of times of given number variable.
# Instead of printing, return the array of percentages.
# Then create a new module called main.py. Gets an input from the user using 
# "Enter repetition number: ". Then call rollDice method with this user input.
# Lastly, print each probability. E.g. "The probability of 0 is 16.20"
