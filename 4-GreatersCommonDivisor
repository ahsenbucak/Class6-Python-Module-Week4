#THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR

# As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of my inputs.

# Acceptance Criteria:

# Ask user the enter the number of inputs (n).
# Ask user to enter n input numbers one by one.
# Use try/except blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for Nan or non numerical inputs.
# Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n numbers.
# Use gcd function in module of math.

from math import gcd

n=""
while type(n)!=int:
    try:
        a=input("Please enter tne number which indicates how much number you want to calculate")
        if type(int(a))==int:
            n=int(a)
    except:
        print("It is Nan.Please enter a number")
nums=[]
while len(nums)!=n:
    try: 
         k=int(input("Please enter the numbers you want to calculate"))
         if type(k)==int:
              nums.append(k)
    except:
         print("it is non numerical input.Please enter a number")
print(gcd(*nums))
